But since it was a buck, I did in fact buy it, and I'm glad I did. It's hella fun. The gameplay loop of joining events and races, using the cash you earn to buy new vehicles and such, and upgrading your vehicles with loot rewards from events and races, is pretty simple. But it is also effective. As you progress, you will unlock more events and races, and because they are located across the lower 48 States, you get a wide variety of settings for everything. From cities to mountains to forests to lakes to deserts to meteor craters to rain to snow to beaches and on and on, there is a vast array of different types of courses and tracks to enjoy. And there are a wide variety of types of races and events as well. From standard track races to boat races to plane aerobatics to demolition derbies, and so on.\n",

And, the various vehicles, be they cars or trucks or bikes or planes or boats or dune buggies or whatever...they all handle nicely and feel good to drive in.

      "There is a campaign of sorts, where you try to become the lead racer in a few different styles, but it's also easy enough to ignore that in favor of simply racing around, upgrading your vehicles, wandering around your crib, and simply free roaming. And free roaming is a lot of fun in and of itself. Mostly, it's a huge sightseeing trip, where you can also try to beat other player's records with jumps, speed, and so on; that you come across while driving around. And setting some records of your own for other people to beat. And there is a decent photography mini game all across the States where you will take pictures of animals, special vehicles and such to gain more cash and follower.\n",

At this moment in time (the time of this review being written), no matter where you are, somebody else is nearby. And there are a lot of player created activities as well. Plus, you can co-op with friends if you get bored of solo play. So really, the content just keeps expanding as you explore what the game has to offer.\n",

It has a 60 FPS cap, which isn't anything to brag about, but somehow, the devs have made the most out of that limitation and made a game that has a never-ending supply of screenshot moments. The audio is also well done. The songs themselves are very cool. The dialogue is basically all \"hey bro\" Extreme Games fodder, but it's fun and definitely appropriate.\n",

      "The Crew 2 est un jeu de course en monde ouvert impressionnant qui m'a véritablement séduit par sa diversité, son accessibilité et sa sensation de liberté. Dès les premières minutes, on est plongé dans un univers vaste et ouvert, où les possibilités sont presque infinies. Que vous soyez fan de courses sur route, de freestyle en avion ou de défis en bateau, The Crew 2 offre une variété de véhicules et de terrains qui garantit de l’action non-stop.\n",
      "Le monde ouvert de The Crew 2 est tout simplement colossal. Vous pouvez traverser les États-Unis d’un bout à l’autre, en passant par des paysages urbains, des montagnes, des déserts et des plages. Ce qui m’a particulièrement plu, c’est la fluidité du passage d'un véhicule à un autre. Que ce soit en voiture, moto, avion ou bateau, il n'y a pas de temps de chargement entre les transitions, ce qui renforce l’immersion et donne un véritable sentiment de liberté. Vous pouvez ainsi explorer à votre rythme, participer à des courses ou simplement vous amuser à découvrir les secrets du jeu.\n",
      "Le gameplay est extrêmement accessible, mais il offre également des challenges pour les joueurs plus expérimentés. Les courses sont variées et bien conçues, allant de simples sprints à des épreuves plus complexes, avec des obstacles et des conditions météo qui modifient l’approche stratégique. Le système de progression est gratifiant, avec de nombreuses personnalisations possibles pour vos véhicules et des événements réguliers qui viennent maintenir l'intérêt à long terme.\n",
      "Visuellement, The Crew 2 est impressionnant. Les graphismes sont de qualité, avec des paysages magnifiques qui changent en fonction des régions que vous traversez. L’effet de vitesse est bien rendu, et la météo dynamique (pluie, neige, brouillard) apporte une dimension supplémentaire à l’expérience de jeu.\n",
      "Le jeu bénéficie également d’une solide composante multijoueur. Que vous jouiez en solo ou avec des amis, les courses et défis en ligne sont toujours une source de fun et de compétition. Les possibilités de jouer avec d'autres pilotes à travers le monde, de créer des équipes et de participer à des événements communautaires donnent une longue durée de vie au jeu.\n",
      "En résumé, The Crew 2 est un jeu de course extrêmement divertissant qui offre une expérience variée et sans limite dans un monde ouvert. Avec ses véhicules divers, ses courses palpitantes et son monde vaste à explorer, il est un excellent choix pour les amateurs de courses et de sensations fortes. Si vous aimez les jeux de course en monde ouvert, The Crew 2 est un jeux a Essayée et à avoir dans votre bibliothèque Steam.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ce qui fait la force de The Crew 2, c'est la diversité de ses véhicules et de ses disciplines. Vous pouvez piloter des voitures de sport, des motos, des bateaux ou encore des avions, le tout dans des environnements différents allant des plages ensoleillées aux montagnes enneigées. Chaque type de véhicule est parfaitement adapté à son environnement, et l'impression de liberté qu'on ressent en explorant les paysages est tout simplement phénoménale. Le système de transitions fluides entre les différents types de véhicules permet de multiplier les expériences sans jamais briser le rythme du jeu.\n",
      "Les graphismes sont splendides, avec des détails minutieux qui rendent chaque paysage vivant et authentique. La modélisation des véhicules est soignée, et chaque bolide a un son unique qui fait frémir les amateurs de moteur.\n",
      "Le système de progression et de personnalisation est également un point fort du jeu. En gagnant des courses et des événements, vous débloquez des véhicules de plus en plus puissants et personnalisables. Cela ajoute une couche de stratégie intéressante, car il faut choisir judicieusement ses véhicules en fonction des événements à venir.\n",
      "De plus, le mode multijoueur est un vrai régal : vous pouvez faire équipe avec vos amis ou affronter d'autres joueurs dans des compétitions épiques. Les événements en ligne sont fréquents et offrent des défis variés qui permettent de garder le jeu frais et excitant pendant de longues heures.\n",
      "En résumé, The Crew 2 est un jeu qui offre une expérience de conduite complète et riche. Que vous soyez un adepte de courses effrénées ou un explorateur désireux de parcourir les vastes paysages d'Amérique, ce jeu saura vous captiver et vous offrir des moments de pur plaisir. Un incontournable pour tous les fans de jeux de course !\n",

      "Bon, pour 1€ je ne peut pas être déçu, le jeu est pratiquement donné à ce niveaux. J'y ai déjà jouée une cinquantaine d'heure il y a quelque années sur PS4. J'aime bien le jeu, il est fluide, carte très grande et généreuse, une variété de contenue et d'activités et une bonne grosse collection de véhicule en tout genre.\n",
      "La grande nouveauté par rapport au premier The Crew (Rest in Peace soldat)c'est la possibilité de changer à sa guiser entre voiture, avion et bateau.\n",
      "Les chargements sont hyper fluide et intégré aux gameplay ce qui fait qu'on a jamais vraiment d'écran de chargement.\n",
      "Cela dit, le jeu a quelque problème malgré tout. Déjà, on dirait qu'il ne sait pas où se placer entre \"Simulation\" et \"Arcade\", le jeu est suffisamment \"exigeant\" mais à côté de ça il y a une physique trè arcade et simplifié. Du coup pendant les première heures j'ai eu énormément de mal à contrôler mon véhicule correctement. En plus j'avais une zone morte par défaut qui était très handicapante (j'ai complètement désactivé ça va bien mieux).\n",
      "Il y a très peu de joueurs sur la map, les sessions ne contiennent pas assez de membre pour être sympa a voyager, c'est dommage. L'histoire est complètement naze mais en même temps c'est pas vraiment pour ça qu'on joue à ce genre de jeux mdr. Un autre point positif c'est que la communauté peut créer des circuits et les partager à tout les joueurs et dans n'importe quel sport. On a aussi des sorte d'évent toute les semaine qui demande d'accumuler des points et de monter dans le classement pour obtenir des récompenses.\n",
      "En bref, c'est un bon jeu mais si vous chercher de la simulation, optez pour Forza ou Forza Horizon qui sont indétrnable à mes yeux. Si vous voulez juste vous amuser sans prise de tête seul ou accompagné je vous le conseille. Il peut être aussi un poil répétitif à force d'enchaîner les activités donc je vous conseille de diversifier votre manière de jouer et d'alterner entre tout les sports pour essayer de ne pas s'ennuyer.\n",

Le jeu m’a surpris par son dynamisme et la diversité des véhicules et environnements à explorer. L’immensité de la carte, couplée à la fluidité du gameplay, rend chaque session de jeu unique et captivante. Que ce soit sur terre, sur l'eau ou dans les airs, la liberté offerte dans le choix des épreuves et des modes de transport est tout simplement grisante.

      "My impression of the game kept on changing at each progressing 5 hours interval. This review was framed after investing 30+ hours into the game and concluding the final rivalry races. The initial hours were so repulsive and full of meh impressions. But once you get a hold of a particular vehicle type and its handling, it’s all fun and excitement.\n",
      "📝Story/Plot:\n",
      "Just a generic plot setup to give your grind some motive and goal. A rookie entering the world of racing and guess what, some organizers see his potential and gave him a chance without even seeing him race beforehand. Just be #1 all around the events and conclude your journey after beating the top dogs who were the organizers too.\n",
      "🎮Gameplay:\n",
      "Initial impression-\n",
      "Imagine a hot girl with no personality. That’s the first 5-minute impression of The Crew 2. Starting off with high budget cinematics and performing short lap segment races while shifting to a new vehicle again and again. Sounds cool right? Wait until you see the whole f*cking world curve like in the movie Inception and Doctor Strange. At this point, my jaw was indisputably touching the ground. But just after completing a normal event race, it hit me with gloom and awkwardness. All that cinematic brag of “Speed is Life” and bla bla comes down to a slow race with the road looking like a low texture road. Like WTF?\n",
      "Mechanics/Controllability-\n",
      "I know it’s not a real sim racing game, nor advertised as a pure arcade. It’s unique on its own. But I feel like not giving it a category works as a bypass for some faulty mechanics. Cars feel slightly slow and weigh a ton on the controller. The purpose of a racing game is to acknowledge the speed atmosphere, which was only endured with top cars. Cars are not at all hard to control, rather easy and amusing. It’s the damn AI that makes all the races so tryhard. You are in lead for 97% of the race and suddenly an AI got a God’s hand and achieved supersonic speed. If you are thinking of bumping into them and play dirty, well have fun bumping a rubber band. All these aspects are blades of the same sword. AI feels difficult- what a tryhard game/Thank God it’s not cheap easy. Perspective matters here. I am not against it. Surely it’s sometimes annoying, but it iz what it iz.\n",
      "It’s easy to understand how ground vehicles operate, steer, brake, drift, boost. But you are not familiar with aeroplane controls. Despite that, the first intro race makes you race an aeroplane. Instead of crossing checkpoints with my plane, I was crashing into enormous buildings and respawning. A terrible scenario that gets fixed in later event races where they teach you all aeroplane controls bit by bit.\n",
      "Open World-\n",
      "Take on the American motorsports scene as you explore across the entire USA. Being able to drive different vehicles like cars, bikes, boats and planes in the same open-world means not only you are free to drift your car on street roads, tread speedboat through the waterways but fly high across the sky too. Befitting pillars for the open-world statement. Now we know there are no restrictions, but what about interactables? Unfortunately, that’s a guessing game. Oh, I have a sharp turn incoming and I have to drift? Let’s do this then. You are halfway in your drift airmailing all those bus shelters, mailboxes, lampposts in space, but suddenly you see a bench in between. That’s your stoppage. These randomly placed objects like benches or parked cars don’t follow Newton’s Law. They just wanna remain stationary no matter how hard you hit them. Trust me, these little objects ruined a lot of my lap times.\n",
      "Variety-\n",
      "You can use the astonishing top-notch live map, which single-handedly increases the game score by 2. Like how they even made it render the entire game in a 3D model just by a single click. Moving forward, the complete map contains various types of events/races you can take part in. Just for clarification, there are not AI vs races only. You can take part in a race against time, drifting, freestyling and a lot of car chases too. As I said, you are buying a complete package of the racing genre with multiple vehicle types. But there seems to be a hollow part of the story. During cinematics, you can easily see the top-quality work put together and the exciting race descriptions they narrate. But in reality, you won’t find those races in action. One cinematic had an image of a monster truck jumping out of a plane with a parachute, but there’s nothing present like that. They escalated the expectations through cinematic dialogues but disappointed us in the end. It’s not completely devastating as the default variety is already more than enough.\n",
      "PvP/Grinding-\n",
      "Sadly, you can’t run away from the “Look, there’s a level 1 guy with lvl99 car” scenario. It’s Ubisoft, which means expect a lot of transactions. Buy bundles, buy a season pass (Motorpass), or add in-game currency and get any high-speed car you want, but if you don’t wanna spend a penny, good luck grinding your a*s out.

      "🏷️Tips to new players:\n",
      "Keep in mind, you can drift your plane. Without this, you are going to kiss the land whenever you take a flight. Don’t start PvP races until you reach at least the Famous rank. There are no restrictions on which racetrack to follow. So cut the track however you want. The first one to cross the checkpoint is the winner. Change resolution to borderless. Otherwise, whenever you will Alt+Tab, the game will start re-syncing, which wastes 4-10 seconds of your life every time.\n",
      "😇Honest Rating:\n",
      "If you are looking for that NFS arcade or real sim racing like Assetto Corsa and Project Cars, then just buy them instead. It’s nowhere perfect or overly marvellous. But I can assure you, if you invest enough hours into the game, you will adore it even as toxic relation. Only buy on big sale!\n",

      "European Citizens' Initiative :\n",
      "Video games have grown into an industry with billions of customers worth hundreds of billions of euros. During this time, a specific business practice in the industry has been slowly emerging that is not only an assault on basic consumer rights but is destroying the medium itself.\n",
      "An increasing number of publishers are selling video games that are required to connect through the internet to the game publisher, or \"phone home\" to function. While this is not a problem in itself, when support ends for these types of games, very often publishers simply sever the connection necessary for the game to function, proceed to destroy all working copies of the game, and implement extensive measures to prevent the customer from repairing the game in any way.\n",
      "This practice is effectively robbing customers of their purchases and makes restoration impossible. Besides being an affront on consumer rights, video games themselves are unique creative works. Like film, or music, one cannot be simply substituted with another. By destroying them, it represents a creative loss for everyone involved and erases history in ways not possible in other mediums.\n",
      "Existing laws and consumer agencies are ill-prepared to protect customers against this practice. The ability for a company to destroy an item it has already sold to the customer long after the fact is not something that normally occurs in other industries. With license agreements required to simply run the game, many existing consumer protections are circumvented. This practice challenges the concept of ownership itself, where the customer is left with nothing after \"buying\" a game.\n",
      "We wish to invoke Article 17 §1 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union [EUR-Lex - 12012P/TXT - EN - EUR-Lex (europa.eu)] – “No one may be deprived of his or her possessions, except in the public interest and in the cases and under the conditions provided for by law, subject to fair compensation being paid in good time for their loss.” – This practice deprives European citizens of their property by making it so that they lose access to their product an indeterminate/arbitrary amount of time after the point of sale. We wish to see this remedied, at the core of this Initiative.\n",
      "We also invoke Title XV of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU)[EUR-Lex - 12012E/TXT - EN - EUR-Lex (europa.eu)] and the following TFEU Articles as our justification for and the Union’s imperative to respond to this initiative:\n",
      "Article 169 – Per §1, the EU has an obligation “to promote the interests of consumers and to ensure a high level of consumer protection…to protecting the health, safety and economic interests of consumers”. We believe this practice infringes upon or requires correction to be commensurate with the EU’s obligation. The actions taken in response to this initiative must supersede any end user license agreements associated with videogames.\n",
      "Article 12 – “Consumer protection requirements shall be taken into account in defining and implementing other Union policies and activities.” Given that this practice extends across Member States and beyond the EU, the Union’s actions regarding this practice ought to keep consumer protection in mind. The actions taken in response to this initiative must supersede any end user license agreements associated with video games.\n",
      "Article 114, §3 – “The Commission, in its proposals envisaged in paragraph 1 concerning health, safety, environmental protection and consumer protection, will take as a base a high level of protection… Within their respective powers, the European Parliament and the Council will also seek to achieve this objective” This practice undermines the high level of consumer protection that the Commission, the European Parliament, and the Council takes as the basis of law in the Union, and their objectives of establishing and maintaining the functioning of an internal market as described in §1 of this Article, and Article 26 TFEU.\n",

      "With the ability to switch to another vehicle whether air or water while driving, you get to realize that there are so many things that this game offers. For me, this is an awesome game, though the sole issue I have with this game is that it is only playable ONLINE. I wish there is a feature where in you can drive around and participate in races even without the online feature or just disabled online mode. In addition to the free-roaming, there are races that provide the player a huge drop of cash and with the ability to increase the number of drop of car parts and money by progressing your ICON stats, you are guaranteed wealthy enough to purchase numerous vehicles of different disciplines that are so many that I am speechless of this game and how amazing it is.\n",
      "To conclude. The Crew 2 is fun. Surely some will say the graphic renditions, especially buildings and environments have awful sight to it, but still, with all honesty, this is a fun game to play.

      "I honestly kind of expected this game to be horrible. But Once I finally got it working, it was a lot more enjoyable then I planned it to be. The main things that strongly irritated me was having to Launch Ubisoft literally anytime I want to play this game, and the fact that Drifting is (not hard but) annoyingly more complex than other racing games.\n",
      "\n",
      "This is better than Motofest. Screw you Ubisoft. Should've just made it as a DLC for this one instead of making it stand-alone.\n",
      "The best Parts of games that play on a larger scale is that they can be expanded with time. Even with paid DLC. Euro Truck Simulator has almost all of Europe. With DLC. Why not looking at the competition?\n",
      "\n",
      "I'd say this game is worth a try. There’s plenty of racing, though it’s kind of like the towers in Assassin’s Creed or Far Cry—you’re constantly grinding for something.\n",
      "About that grind: collecting tuning parts (to get bonuses, you need to put together a full set of the same color and type) can be a hassle. Don’t expect to complete a set easily—you’ll likely be replaying the same race multiple times. There are around 200 races in total, each with three difficulty levels. I’ve cleared 88% of the main races and about 51% of the three other categories, and I’m nowhere near completing a full set on any car. But honestly, you don't need a full set. Once you max out your car’s power, you can just blow past the AI ​​opponents and enjoy the view.\n",
      "And the views here are worth it. The game is gorgeous, and the scale is impressive. You truly feel like you’re driving across an entire country. The map might even be bigger than Euro Truck Simulator's, even with all the DLC. Each state has its own distinct look and vibe, and I loved the variety.\n",
      "The one downside is that the game kind of forces you to try different modes. I wasn’t really into planes or Off-Road, though the boat races were surprisingly fun. Some modes just feel pointless, like Derby. It’s just cars bouncing around with no real destruction physics. And F1 racing doesn’t really fit either—the arcade physics don’t do it justice, and when you’re driving an F1 car off-road, it’s just weird.\n",
      "At first, I hated Off-Road races and was ready to skip them. I tried MX, Aerobatics, and Touring Car instead, but that sense of “incomplete” pushed me to finish those 20 Off-Road races, unlock the boss, and complete all the achievements.\n",
      "Overall, the game’s pretty easy—maybe too easy. To make it more challenging, you’d have to clear everything on the easiest difficulty first, and with a game this big, that can get tiring. I put in 30 hours and only got through half the game. I really enjoyed the hypercars, though; I’d be down for even more long races that last an hour or more. There’s something special about speeding down a wide-open highway, listening to music, and soaking up the graphics.\n",
      "In short, there’s something for everyone here, so I’d say it’s worth a thumbs-up.\n",
      "\n",
      "I decided to play this game rather than leave it in the steam library simply because Ubisoft decided to close the server of the crew 1 rather than proving a patch of allowing players to play offline. It's shameful. Back to this, a perfect touring game, a bad game, a terrible racing game. There are too many I can criticise about this game: terrible car selection in the menu, terrible handling and driving feedback, lacking of vehicle trade or hiding, and the worst is demolition derby. However there are many good about this game as well: large map and beautiful landscape, nice weather system and the best is the diversity of vehicles. Overall this game deserves a thumb up, Ubisoft is not. Now I think it's time to bring Vivendi back and put some pressure to Ubi.\n",
      "\n",
      "Middle thumb really, its not bad, but not great either. Graphics weirdly dont look as good as the screenshots, i cant figure out why as i have the game on the highest graphics settings. It does have some nice cars in it, Including all the modern day Lotus cars which was nice to see, however, physics feel okay i guess, nothing special. Impressive size map, and has some really interesting places in it. Story? why bother, If i wanted a story I would read a book from a bestselling author. Gameplay is what I come here for and rate a game on. Overall, I think Forza Horizon series is better, but this is a fair entry to this genre. I've uninstalled it after an hour or 2, just plenty better else about that warrant my time more. Got it for 80p so i guess it even broke even on the £1 an hour i set as valuer for money  haha.\n",

I got it originally because the discount was just too much to pass up but didn't expect to enjoy it nearly as much as I have and will continue to do. This title made me realize I love racing games.\n",
      "I don't know how deep any of the activities are compared to the competition in the genre but it's pure good fun. There's lots of variety in event types and tons of vehicles with impressive customization. The drawbacks are that the characters are insufferable, just about every line of dialog is cringe inducing and the voice acting is wretchedly bad — but fortunately none of that matters in a game like this. Maybe that's a plus if you can laugh at it, but for me skipping just about all of it is mandatory.\n",

The city looks alive with night lights. In the countryside away from the cities, even at medium graphics, the visual are breathtaking, dawn & dusk produce breathtaking orange colors. When it rains everything looks beautiful.\n",
      "Unfortunately, this game can’t produce stable 60 FPS at medium settings on my GTX 1650, Forza Horizon 5 ran smoothly with just 8 GB of RAM on the same Lenovo Legion Y540. While playing this Crew 2 game, I had upgraded the laptop to 16 GB. I even reduced some graphics settings to low but it still struggled to stay above 50 FPS.\n",
      "The game never crashed, initial loading time is long but afterwards it is very quick. This game to me is on the same level as Forza Horizon but it is superior to FH because of its variety of races, it has theme based races – Racing games from Cartridge era (Flashback races), Ghost hunting van, Tron like bike races, Racing towards Alien landing site, cars and bikes racing together, etc.\n",
      "Humans walking around the street in the city makes this game more ‘realistic’ than Forza Horizon which only shows humans in an enclosure where the car can’t hurt them. But neither of the games have Police no matter  how much destruction your driving causes.\n",
      "This game is too big to be played to completion for someone with a hundred unplayed games in Steam library but at 30 hours I managed to see most of the good stuff. Water & Air based races are not my favourites but the land racing > Street, Hypercars, Rally and Motorcycle were worth the time.\n",

The good news is, despite all those flaws it is still very much fun! and is worth it just for the amount of content it has alone, you like classic/hyper cars? motorcycles? perhaps you're here for some rally racing & off-roading instead? how about some boat racing & hovercrafts? planes? no? then surely you like monster trucks! not even that? okay, i know what you can't say no to, demolition derbies!\n",

      "The good:\n",
      "+ The graphics are pretty good for a 6 years old game, except for the NPCs, we don't talk about those.\n",
      "+ A huge selection of cars & vehicles from various time periods, you're sure to find something you'll enjoy, the handling was alright for the most part, and most vehicles felt different enough to drive to warrant switching things up from time to time.\n",
      "+ A huge map full of all sorts of races and activities, you'll either love it or hate it, there are like a billion icons on the map for you to clear up, typical Ubisoft stuff, you won't unlock it all at once though. (it was a bit too much for me tbh, especially the billion skills & photos, but it's still content for those who care ig?)\n",
      "+ Some key bindings felt weird on planes & boats but thankfully everything was very customizable with various sliders for everything you could possibly want to adjust, very extensive vehicle tuning too!\n",
      "+ They also added a few unique fun events in almost all disciplines, with special aesthetics & unique soundtracks, some even form their own mini-stories/events, they're a bit on the shorter side though.\n",
      "+ When playing with friends, as long as one of you wins everyone gets the same rewards, big +++\n",
      "+ The game ran almost perfectly for me with rare dips here and there, nothing game-breaking though, i also only experienced 2-3 crashes so far (from what i recall anyways).\n",
      "The Bad:\n",
      "- Cars are way too expensive imo, it felt so jarring coming from Forza Horizon 4 to this, depending on how much you play you could end up spending days saving for a single vehicle, i really hate that & it's one of my biggest gripes with TC2, as i'm someone who likes to experiment with different cars instead of directly buying the meta thing and never looking back. (For context, i'm 225h in and i only have 147 out of 626 vehicles)\n",
      "- No real character creator, you also can't change your avatar once you pick it up so you better choose well!\n",
      "- The servers will randomly disconnect & kick you out without saving your progress, it didn't happen all the time but still enough to be pretty irritating.\n",
      "- Although almost everything can be played with friends, some of the coolest & most unique races are solo only, especially the ones where you switch vehicles mid-race, shame..\n",

      "\n",
      "Was it worth buying this game at a huge discount?\n",
      "The Crew 2 is a sequel to the 2014 racing game. It is, of course, a racing game in which we race mainly with bots, and it's better not to comment on the online mode, because it's not done well, so we either race with bots or with friends in a party. Everything is garnished with a boring storyline, about which there is nothing to write too much, because this is a racing game and it is not very important in it. What sets The Crew 2 apart from other racing games is that in addition to classic cars, we also race other vehicles such as airplanes, boats and monster trucks.\n",
      "Cars and game modes\n",
      "Let's start, perhaps, with just a large selection of different vehicles. As I mentioned in the game, I have a choice of ordinary cars, racing cars, cars for Drag Race, various types of aircraft, boats. All this results in a large number of game modes, where, of course, most consist of beating opponents in a race. However, there are also time trials or demolition derby. On top of that, there are all sorts of tests on the map, which require us to exceed a certain speed or escape to a certain distance. Plus taking pictures, which may not be something particularly interesting, but it's always some additional activity.\n",
      "Gameplay\n",
      "However, the problem arises in the gameplay itself.\n",
      "In The Crew 2 it is impossible to lose.\n",
      "To win a race you just have to drive ahead and not hit the wall, that's all it takes to always arrive in first place or at least in TOP3 (which already gives us finishing the race and counting it towards progression) This makes the game trivial and doesn't challenge us at all, the bots can't beat us if we don't do very big stupid things like driving into buildings at full speed. This game is not a simulator, but it is too simple. On the other hand, we have, for example, flying an airplane, where the very feeling of flying is much more difficult, and sometimes even annoying, but it poses some challenge. This shows that it was possible to create a more difficult game. In general, the feeling of driving depending on the vehicle and game mode is different, but it is no problem to beat every race the first time. The game also lacks proper vehicle physics. For example, in another racing game, Grid 2, after hitting a wall, we were often unable to drive further because our vehicle was useless. And in The Crew 2? We drive on as if nothing ever happened, the car runs and drives even after driving into a wall 300 km/h.\n",
      "It should also be noted that in The Crew 2 we upgrade our car with parts we get after completing a race. Initially, this may seem like an interesting game mechanic, but when combined with the hopeless AI that we are able to beat without developing the car, it becomes meaningless. Even a minimal vehicle upgrade makes the game even simpler, and the bots are unable to catch up with us.\n",
      "Graphics and map\n",
      "The map in The Crew 2 is sizable, but it is not particularly interesting. There are places that look nice and interesting, but it doesn't encourage you to explore and drive from race to race. This also goes for the graphics, which are so-so. Cars and areas outside the city are even nicely done, but already in the city it looks at least poor, the buildings are ugly and there is no pleasure in driving around the city. Again, effects such as water and weather effects are really well done. I'll point out right away that the sound design of the cars is good, and the music itself is so-so, rather nothing special, but nothing annoying either.\n",
      "It is also worth noting that there is an option to create your own paintings, or use the paintings of other users. This is only a cosmetic element, but I think it's worth mentioning, because we are not limited by a few basic paint schemes.\n",
      "And why do random animals pop up in random places on the map, which simply run in front of our hood and we can't even interact with them?\n",
      "Summary\n",
      "The Crew 2 is a game I enjoyed playing at the beginning, when I still didn't quite know what I would encounter later. The longer one plays this title the more one sees all the shortcomings. This game is simply too simple and doesn't offer any challenge, and everything is wrapped up with poor gameplay, lack of vehicle physics, empty grimy world, trivial races, stupid AI. Is it worth buying this game at full price? Of course not. And was it worth buying it at a discount of -98%? Also no, because this game is not worth any money.\n",

      "Ubi$oft investors saw their numbers go down, so what a better way to make sales than to sell the game for 1$? All they care about is to make sales, not have a fanbase. Their investors will still invest and Ubi$oft will keep releasing easy money grabs instead of actual games. Greedy corporation. I could spend an entire week talking about their shady tactics, a friend for example has made the bad decision to buy a Ubi$oft subscription for 18€, when he asked for a refund two hours later he only got 14€, with absolutely NO explanation on why this was the case.

      "Update: I refunded this game—not because I needed my $4 back, but out of sheer frustration. Ubisoft doesn’t deserve it for what felt like an unnecessarily painful experience.\n",
      "I grabbed The Crew 2 for a dollar, thinking it would be a fun, low-stakes game to enjoy with my kids. Expectations were low because, well, $1. But even with the bar set that low, this game somehow managed to underdeliver. What we thought would be a quick, fun multiplayer session turned into a confusing, frustrating mess that left us baffled.\n",
      "Here’s the thing—we never even got to the multiplayer. Between the absurdly confusing menus and being forced through tutorial missions that drag on and on, we couldn’t even figure out how to set up a basic multiplayer session. It makes no sense. After nearly an hour of trying to navigate through the cluttered, poorly designed menus, we gave up. And believe me, I’ve had waterboarding training that was less torture than this.\n",
      "Ubisoft still has the audacity to charge $49.99 for this game. That's $50 for a product that can’t even guide players through its most basic functions. They even have the nerve to offer Special and Gold editions at $59.99 and $89.99, but I can't for the life of me figure out what you're actually paying for with those.\n",
      "The driving mechanics are another headache. The cars handle like oversized bouncy balls, with physics that are laughably bad for a driving game. Every attempt to enjoy the driving experience feels like a fight with the controls. To add insult to injury, there’s a 60 FPS lock, which feels outdated and unnecessary, especially when better performance is standard in so many other games.\n",
      "And then there’s the world itself. It’s big, sure—but it’s empty, bland, and devoid of any meaningful interaction. Ubisoft built a massive map but forgot to fill it with anything interesting or engaging. It feels like a missed opportunity on every level.\n",
      "The worst part is, this game pushes microtransactions like they’re doing you a favor. Even after charging $50, they still try to squeeze more money out of players. If you want to progress faster or get better vehicles, guess what? You’re expected to pay more. It’s clearly designed to milk every penny out of players rather than delivering a solid experience upfront.\n",
      "In the end, this game feels unfinished and outdated. Ubisoft should be embarrassed to still sell this at full price. I’m writing this not for me—I’ve already refunded it—but as a warning to anyone thinking of buying it. Save your money and your time, even if it’s on sale for $1.\n",

Apparantly it is supposed to be a career gameplay menu, not a game menu. Button that resumes the game called \"Quit\". So when you press it, you just resume the game. Which means that is part of gameplay, not part of game control. But there are settings and other staff, that is not a part of a gameplay menu.\n",

      "I bought it long ago only because I have almost zero racing games in my collection and sometimes I want to ride cars/motorcycles. And each time I install GTA5 for it.
